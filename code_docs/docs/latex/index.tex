Top-\/down arcade shooter featuring waves of enemies in procedurally generated levels. For our main technical goals, we chose to implement\-: Procedural generation, performance optimization, and controller support. This would work perfectly in our game because we could randomly generate the layout of each level, while watching performance with the massive hordes of zombies that will be spawned, the player uses W\-A\-S\-D and his mouse for movement and shooting. The scope for our game is reachable by our team, while maintaining creative possibilities.\hypertarget{index_install_sec}{}\section{Installation}\label{index_install_sec}
